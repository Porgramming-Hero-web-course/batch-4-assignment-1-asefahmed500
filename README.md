# Why Are Type Guards Necessary? A Look at the Different Types and Use Cases

## Introduction
One of the things I love about TypeScript is its static typing, which makes my code safer and less prone to errors. But what really stands out to me is the concept of **Type Guards**. They give me the ability to work confidently with dynamic data by determining the type of a variable at runtime. In this post, I’ll walk through why Type Guards are so important, explore the different types available, and show how I use them in my own projects.

## Why Are Type Guards Important?
When I work with data that could have multiple types — such as when using union types or unknown types — Type Guards become incredibly useful. They help me narrow down a variable to a specific type before I start interacting with it. This reduces the risk of errors, makes my code easier to understand, and overall just helps keep things clean and maintainable. In short, Type Guards help me avoid runtime mistakes by ensuring I'm working with the right type at the right time.

## Types of Type Guards and How I Use Them

### The `typeof` Type Guard
The `typeof` operator is one of the easiest and most effective Type Guards I use. It helps me check if a variable is a specific primitive type, like `string`, `number`, or `boolean`.

For example, if I’m building a function that might receive either a string or a number, I can use the `typeof` guard to handle each case properly:

```typescript
function handleInput(input: string | number) {
  if (typeof input === "string") {
    console.log(`The length of the string is: ${input.length}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`The square of the number is: ${input * input}`);
  }
}
